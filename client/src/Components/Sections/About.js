                    I am a self taught software developer. Digging into my new passion, I focused on learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript before putting it all together by learning React.<br /><br />
                    At my first start up, <p>MunchkinLabs</p> I was hired to join a small team of developers, responsible for a majority of the front end code and quickly learned what I needed to contribute to a fast growing environment. <br /><br />
                    After seeing the <p>"Groupify"</p> app built by my team and I at MunchkinLabs, I made the decision with a business partner to leave and start my own company.<br /><br />
                    I have since built and launched my greatest product yet, <p>Maxum</p>. The best showcase of everything I had learned until that point condensed into a full stack mobile app, available on the app store!<br /><br />
                    Since then I have worked on various other projects including <p>"coldcallcrushers.com"</p>, which is an AI personalized email generator specific to the sales industry.<br /><br />
                    When I am not working on my latest projects, I can be found at various pick up basketball locations around San Diego, hanging at the beach, or playing chess!
